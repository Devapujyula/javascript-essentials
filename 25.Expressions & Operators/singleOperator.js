/**
 * There is no official term called "single operators" in JavaScript â€” but interviewers or some tutorials may casually refer to:

Unary Operators (aka "single operand operators")
ðŸ”¹ These operate on only one operand (value or variable).

So when someone says "single operator", they likely mean:

ðŸ‘‰ Unary Operators

âœ… Why Are Unary Operators Used?
Unary operators:

Perform operations like negating, incrementing, type conversion, and deleting

Work with only one operand (unlike binary operators which need two)
