// JAVASCRIPT DATA TYPES

Premitive Data Types: These are immutable

number:
Signed
Unsigned
Float
Double
Decimal
Exponent
Binary
Hexa
Octa

String:
Single quote ''
Double Quote ""
back tick ``  ${}

boolean:
true
false 

null
undefined

Non Primitive Data Types: These are mutable

array: reduce over head and complexity
var products = []
var array = new Array()
array support destructuring

methods used in JavaScript:

toString()
join()
slice()

for..in
for..of
map()  -> It is iterator in JavaScript we use Iterators in React we do not use loops 

indexOf()
lastIndexOf()

push()
unshift()

pop()
shift()
splice()

Sorting:
sort()
reverse()

Searching:
find()
filter()

object:
SIMULA is 1st object oriented programming
It is used to keep all related data and logic together
var persons = {"name" : "Prakash", "age" : 26, "hobby":"Reading Mythology"}
There are 2 forms of data XML and JSON now a days every one working on JSON 
In JS we have both JSON and JS Functionalities
If there is any logic it is not JSON 
JSON donot have any logic

map:
It is key and value collection
It provides implicit methods to manipulate 
It provides implicit iterators
It is fast
It is not for structured data

methods in maps:
set()
get()
keys()
values()
entries()
delete()
has()
clear()

set:

The major issue with the structured data in JavaScript is unique identification ---> internally used a concept called SYMBOL

SYMBOL 
It is primitive 
It hidden from iterators 
It is implicity used for iterators

Date is defined by using Date()

Syntax
var mfd = new Date() // Current date and time
var mfg = new Date("2025-05-24 15:28:23,87")

acess the dates by methods:
getHours()
getMinutes()
getSeconds()
getMilliSeconds()
getDate()
getDay()
getMonth()
getFullYear()

// above all are come by numbers only logic needed to display ny string or numbers formate
