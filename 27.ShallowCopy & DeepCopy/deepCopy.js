/**
 * âœ… What Is a Deep Copy?
A deep copy:
-Copies everything, including nested objects/arrays.
-The copy is completely independent of the original.
ðŸ§  Itâ€™s like cloning all levels of the structure.

// âœ… Deep Copy Example (using structuredClone)
const original = {
  name: "Ram",
  address: {
    city: "Ayodhya",
  },
};

const deep = structuredClone(original); // Deep copy

deep.name = "Lakshman"; // âœ… safe
deep.address.city = "Hasthinapur"; // âœ… doesn't affect original

console.log(original.address.city); // Ayodhya

// structuredClone() is built-in and recommended for deep cloning most types of data.

var x = { a: 10, b: 20, address: { area: "Hyderabad" } };
