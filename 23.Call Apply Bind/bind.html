    <h1><u>Bind Method</u></h1>
    <h3>
      just like the call method, bind also allows us to manually set this
      keywords for any function call. The bind method creates a new function
      that, when invoked, has itâ€™s this keyword set to the provided value.
      Unlike call or apply, bind does not immediately execute the function but
      returns a new function with the specified this context where this keyword
      is bound. We can also set default parameters in advance when using bind,
      which essentially involves pre-defining certain arguments beforehand. This
      approach follows a common pattern called partial application, where some
      of the original function's arguments are pre-applied.
