Why call, apply, and bind?
-They are methods available on all JavaScript functions. Their main use is to:
-Explicitly set the value of this
-Control function invocation
-Borrow methods from other objects

ðŸ”¸ When to use what:
-Use call when invoking a function immediately with custom this and separate arguments.
-Use apply when arguments are already in an array.
-Use bind when you want to save a function with a fixed this for later use.

ðŸ”¸ Why important in real apps?
-Event handling (bind)
-Callback context correction
-React classes
-Method reuse (borrowing methods)
