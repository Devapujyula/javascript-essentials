/**
 * Hoisting in JavaScript
 * Hoisting is JavaScript's default behaviour of moving declarations to the top
 * JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initilizations
 * Note: Best practice is to declare all variables at top before using them
 * 
 * | Feature                   | `var`       | `let` / `const`          |
| ------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------ |
| Hoisted                   | ‚úÖ Yes       | ‚úÖ Yes                    |
| Initialized               | ‚úÖ At hoist  | ‚ùå After declaration line |
| TDZ Exists?               | ‚ùå No        | ‚úÖ Yes                    |
| Access before declaration | ‚úÖ undefined | ‚ùå ReferenceError         |


‚úÖ What is the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)?
The Temporal Dead Zone is the time between when a variable is hoisted and when it is initialized, during which you cannot access the variable ‚Äî doing so will throw a ReferenceError.

This happens with variables declared using let and const.

 */

console.log(a); // undefined
var a = 10;

var a; // Declaration is hoisted
console.log(a); // undefined (default value)
a = 10; // Assignment stays in place

console.log(b); // ‚ùå ReferenceError: Cannot access 'b' before initialization
let b = 20;

greet();
function greet() {
  console.log("Good Morning.!");
}

{
  // TDZ starts
  // TDZ means time between the begining of the scope and the declaration, during whuch accessing the variable causes an error
  console.log(x); // ‚ùå ReferenceError
  // TDZ ends
}

/**
‚úÖ var is hoisted and initialized as undefined

‚ö†Ô∏è let and const are hoisted but uninitialized (TDZ)

‚úÖ Function declarations are hoisted fully

‚ö†Ô∏è Function expressions are not callable before definition

üß† Variable shadowing inside functions is a very common bug source
